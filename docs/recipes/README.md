# Agent recipes — wrap any agent behind Warden

Drop-in Docker Compose recipes that put a popular agent runtime behind Warden so
**every byte of its egress is policy-checked, TLS-terminated, secret-swapped, and
logged** — and the agent has no way around it.

Each recipe is the same shape; only the agent image, ports, and CA-trust knobs
change. Start here, then jump to your runtime:

| Recipe | Runtime | Agent UI | Node fetch workaround? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ZeroClaw](zeroclaw.md) | Rust single binary | `http://localhost:42617` | No (reqwest honors env natively) |
| [OpenClaw](openclaw.md) | Node self-hosted assistant | `http://localhost:18789/` | **Yes** (`NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`) |
| [Hermes Agent](hermes.md) | Node + OpenAI-compatible API | `http://localhost:8642` (dash `:9119`) | **Yes** (`NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`) |
| [Ethos](ethos.md) | Node agent (web UI + API) | `http://localhost:3000` (API `:3001`) | **Yes** (`NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`) |

Warden's own dashboard is always at **http://localhost:9090/dashboard/** (+ `/metrics`).

## The isolation pattern (shared by every recipe)

The guarantee is structural, not configured-in-good-faith: the agent is placed on
a Docker network with **no route to the internet**, and the only service that
*does* have egress is Warden. Even a fully compromised agent has nowhere to send
data except through the gate.

Three networks make the boundary real:

```
        ┌──────────────── <agent>-internal (internal: true — NO internet) ┐
        │                                                                  │
  ┌─────┴──────┐      CONNECT + TLS       ┌────────────────┐               │
  │   agent    │ ───────────────────────► │  warden proxy  │ ──────────────┼──► internet
  │ placeholder│  HTTPS_PROXY=warden:8080 │ real secrets,  │               │   (egress net,
  │ keys; trust│                          │ TLS terminate, │               │    warden only)
  │  the CA    │                          │ policy + swap  │               │
  └─────┬──────┘                          └────────────────┘               │
        │                                                                   │
        │   ┌──────────┐  host:<uiport>                                     │
        └───┤ ui socat ├──────────────► frontend bridge ──► your browser    │
            └──────────┘   (forwarder only; no agent egress)                │
        └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **`<agent>-internal`** (`internal: true`) — the agent lives here, and only here.
  Docker gives it no default route, so direct egress is impossible.
- **`egress`** — real internet, attached to **Warden only**.
- **`frontend`** — carries only the `socat` UI forwarder and its host port. The
  agent is never on this network, so exposing its UI grants it no internet route.

The `ui` service is a tiny `alpine/socat` hop: `internal: true` networks can't
publish host ports, so it forwards `host:<uiport> -> <agent>:<uiport>` to make the
web UI reachable without ever giving the agent a way out.

## Two gotchas every recipe handles

**1. Trust the CA.** Warden terminates TLS by presenting a leaf cert signed by its
own CA. The agent must trust that CA or it rejects every HTTPS call with an x509
error. Every recipe mounts `proxy-ca.crt` read-only and points the runtime's trust
env at it:

| Runtime knob | Picked up by |
|---|---|
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | OpenSSL, Rust (reqwest), most native clients |
| `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` | Python `requests` |
| `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` | `curl` |
| `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` | Node.js / bundled JS tools |

**2. Node ignores the proxy by default.** Node's built-in `fetch` (undici) does
**not** honor `HTTP(S)_PROXY` unless `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` is set (Node ≥ ~v20).
Without it, a Node agent's `fetch()` calls go direct, hit the dead-end internal
network, and fail with `fetch failed` — they never reach Warden. So the
**OpenClaw**, **Hermes**, and **Ethos** recipes set it; **ZeroClaw** (Rust/reqwest, which
honors the env natively) does not.

## Secrets stay with Warden, never the agent

In every recipe the agent is handed **placeholder** tokens (e.g.
`openrouter_secret_001`, `openai_secret_001`), never real keys. Warden swaps the
placeholder for the real secret at the edge, so a leaked agent leaks nothing
usable. The starter `configs/config.recipe.yaml` ships allow-all with no swaps
configured; add `secrets:` placeholder→envVar mappings (and the real keys in
**Warden's** environment only) when you tighten the policy.

## Verify isolation (works for every recipe)

Bring a recipe up, then exec into the agent container and prove both directions:

```sh
# 1. Through Warden — succeeds (and shows up in the dashboard):
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.<tool>.yml \
  exec <tool> sh -c 'curl -sS --max-time 10 https://example.com -o /dev/null -w "via proxy: %{http_code}\n"'

# 2. Bypassing the proxy — FAILS, because the agent has no direct route out:
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.<tool>.yml \
  exec <tool> sh -c 'curl -sS --noproxy "*" --max-time 5 https://example.com' \
  ; echo "exit: $?"
```

The first call returns an HTTP code and appears at
**http://localhost:9090/dashboard/**. The second times out or fails to resolve —
the proof that Warden is the *only* way out. (Distroless agent images may lack a
shell; run the same two `curl` commands from any sidecar on `<tool>-internal`, or
read the dashboard's Traffic / Blocked views instead.)

## Tighten the policy

Allow-all is for first-run visibility. Once you can see the agent's real traffic
in the dashboard, edit `configs/config.recipe.yaml`: replace the `~.*` catch-all
with the specific hosts the agent needs, and add `secrets:` mappings so the agent
only ever holds placeholders. See `docs/docker-end-to-end.md` for the full
allowlist + secret-swap walkthrough.
